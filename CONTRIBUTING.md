### The Global Sprint and Internet Health
This year we're Sprinting on projects that promote, protect and build the open Web, in line with Mozilla's key issues for Internet health.  

* **OPEN INNOVATION**: projects that help anyone publish or invent online without asking permission and/or ensure that technologies used to run the Web are transparent and understandable.
* **PRIVACY & SECURITY**: projects that support our ability to understand what is happening to our data online, and our ability to control how that data is used.
* **DIGITAL INCLUSION**: projects that help ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to access the Internet and can use it to improve their lives and societies.
* **WEB LITERACY**: projects that promote or teach the skills to read, write, and participate in the digital world-- and the ability to shape (not just consume) the Web.
* **DECENTRALIZATION**: projects that help protect and secure an Internet controlled by many so, that no one actor can own it or control it or switch it off.


### Finding Tasks and Making Contributions
During the Sprint, you'll contact the Lead on the project you'd like to work on, and volunteer to help out with a task. Be sure to ask any questions you have, and then get to work! When you've completed your task, you'll submit your work for review by the Project Lead, who'll provide, feedback, comments, gratitude... and if all goes well, the Project Lead will incorporate your work into the project. Yay!

At the Sprint, you'll probably browse project tasks, called "Issues", in an online collaboration platform called GitHub. Some projects will have their code and content there in GitHub as well; some will be working with other collaboration tools, like Google Docs or Etherpad. 

If the project you choose is working primarily on GitHub, you may find it helpful to open a free account on GitHub. This is easy, quick, and, again free! Once you have an account, you can comment on issues and the project lead can add you to tasks. You can also contribute work to the project using GitHub.
